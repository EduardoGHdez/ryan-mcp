# Ryan ðŸ¤–

A simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides friendly greetings and tools.

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Install Ryan as a global command so you can use it from anywhere:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ryan
./bin/setup

# Install globally using rake
rake install
```

Now you can run `ryan` from anywhere in your terminal! ðŸŽ‰

### Manual Installation

If you prefer the manual approach:

```bash
gem build ryan.gemspec
gem install ryan-1.0.0.gem
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install Ryan globally** (see installation section above)

2. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   ryan        # Starts the MCP server (Ctrl+C to stop)
   rake test   # Run tests (from project directory)
   ```

## Configure in Cursor

Add this to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ryan": {
      "command": "ryan"
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask Cursor: *"Hey Ryan, can you greet Alice?"*

## Available Tools
